                    Gonana has implemented a very simple and fast payment system
                    for settlement that is deployed on the blockchain (Moonbeam
                    protocol) with cross-chain capabilities on Algorand, XDC,
                    Evmos, Solana, Acala, Celo and Near to give the farmers a
                    true blockchain experience with a simple web3 design.

                    This is to help the farmers take as much profit as possible
                    as a reward for the hard work they put on production. There
                    will be no hidden charges due to Gonana as a company or any

                    We have implemented a payment system that is easy to use and
                    also an exchange that permits the farmers to swap their
                    token for another. This also means that they can stake,
                    swap, lend, and borrow while earning some profit for their
                    Defi activities. This is to help the farmers have a holistic
                    approach to Defi and Cefi. Also, farmers get a multi-chain
                    exchange where they can use assets from other blockchain
                    protocols like Algorand, XDC, Evmos, Acala, Celo, Solana and
                    Near.{" "}
